My notes

SHUFFLING 

First I selected the cards and turned the returned list of cards to an array. Then I used the function provided to shuffle 
the cards and then I appended each card to the deck, based on the new index they got. The cards were not created but rearranged
with .appendChild() which placed them in que as last child of the parent element, one at a time.
